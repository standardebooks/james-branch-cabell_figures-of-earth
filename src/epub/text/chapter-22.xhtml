			<p>Now the tale tells how Dom Manuel sat at the feet of the image and played upon a flageolet. There was wizardry in the music, Dom Manuel said afterward, for he declared that it evoked in him a vision and a restless dreaming that followed after Misery.</p>
			<p>So this dreaming showed that when Misery was dispossessed of the earth he entered (because Misery is unchristian) into the paradise of the pagans, where Niafer, dead now for something over a year, went restlessly in bliss: and Misery came shortly afterward to Niafer, and talked with her in a thin little voice. She listened willingly to this talk of Manuel and of the adventures which Niafer had shared with Manuel: and now that she remembered Manuel, and his clear young face and bright unequal eyes and his strong arms, she could no longer be even moderately content in the paradise of the pagans.</p>
			<p>Thereafter Misery went about the heathens’ paradise in the appearance of a light formless cloud. And the fields of this paradise seemed less green, the air became less pure and balmy, and the sky less radiant, and the waters of the paradisal river Eridanus grew muddy. The poets became tired of hearing one another recite, the heroes lost delight in their wrestling and chariot racing and in their exercises with the spear and the bow. “How can anybody expect us to waste eternity with recreations which are only fitted to waste time?” they demanded.</p>
			<p>And the lovely ladies began to find the handsome lovers with whom they wandered hand in hand through never-fading groves of myrtle, and with whom they were forever reunited, rather tedious companions.</p>
			<p>“I love you,” said the lovers.</p>
			<p>“You have been telling me that for twelve centuries,” replied the ladies, yawning, “and too much of anything is enough.”</p>
			<p>“Upon my body, I think so too,” declared the lovers. “I said it only out of politeness and force of habit, and I can assure you I am as tired of this lackadaisical idiocy as you are.”</p>
			<p>So everything was at sixes and sevens in this paradise: and when the mischief-maker was detected, the blessed held a meeting, for it was now the day of All Souls, on which the dead have privilege.</p>
			<p>“We must preserve appearances,” said these dead pagans, “and can have only happy-looking persons hereabouts, for otherwise our paradise will get a poor name, and the religion of our fathers will fall into disrepute.”</p>
			<p>Then they thrust Misery, and Niafer also, out of the pagan paradise, because Misery clung to Niafer in the appearance of a light formless cloud, and there was no separating the two.</p>
			<p>These two turned earthward together, and came to the river of sweat called Rigjon. Niafer said to the fiery angel Sandalfon that guards the bridge there, “The Misery of earth is with me.”</p>
			<p>Sandalfon saw that this was so, and answered, “My fires cannot consume the Misery of earth.”</p>
			<p>They came to Hadarniel, the noisy angel whose, whispering is the thunder. Niafer said, “The Misery of earth is with me.”</p>
			<p>Hadarniel replied, “Before the Misery of earth I am silent.”</p>
			<p>They came to Kemuel and his twelve thousand angels of destruction that guard the outermost gateway. Niafer said, “The Misery of earth is with me.”</p>
			<p>Kemuel answered, “I ruin and make an end of all things else, but for the Misery of earth I have contrived no ending.”</p>
			<p>So Misery and Niafer passed all the warders of this paradise: and in a dim country on the world’s rim the blended spirit of Misery and the ghost of Niafer rose through a hole in the ground, like an imponderable vapor. They dissevered each from the other in a gray place overgrown with poplars, and Misery cried farewell to Niafer.</p>
			<p>“And very heartily do I thank you for your kindness, now that we part, and now that, it may be, I shall not ever see you again,” said Niafer, politely.</p>
			<p>Misery replied:</p>
			<p>“Take no fear for not seeing me again, now that you are about once more to become human. Certainly, Niafer, I must leave you for a little while, but certainly I shall return. There will first be for you much kissing and soft laughter, and the quiet happy ordering of your home, and the heart-shaking wonder of the child who is neither you nor Manuel, but both of you, and whose life was not ever seen before on earth: and life will burgeon with white miracles, and every blossom you will take to be eternal. Laughing, you will say of sorrow, ‘What is it?’ And I, whom some call Béda, and others call Kruchina, shall be monstrously amused by this.</p>
			<p>“Then your seeing will have my help, and you will observe that Manuel is very much like other persons. He will be used to having you about, and you him, and that will be the sorry bond between you. The children that have reft their flesh from your flesh ruthlessly, and that have derived their living from your glad anguish, each day will, be appearing a little less intimately yours, until these children find their mates. Thereafter you will be a tolerated intruder into these children’s daily living, and nobody anywhere will do more than condone your coming: you will weep secretly: and I, whom some call Béda, and others call Kruchina, shall be monstrously amused by this.</p>
			<p>“Then I shall certainly return to you, when your tears are dried, and when you no longer believe what young Niafer once believed; and when, remembering young Niafer’s desires and her intentions as to the disposal of her life, you will shrug withered shoulders. To go on living will remain desirable. The dilapidations of life will no longer move you deeply. Shrugging, you will say of sorrow, ‘What is it?’ for you will know grief also to be impermanent. And your inability to be quite miserable any more will assure you that your goings are attended by the ghost of outlived and conquered misery: and I, whom some call Béda, and others call Kruchina, shall be monstrously amused by this.”</p>
			<p>Said Niafer, impatiently, “Do you intend to keep me here forever under these dark twinkling trees, with your thin little talking, while Manuel stays unhappy through his want of me?”</p>
			<p>And Misery answered nothing as he departed from Niafer, for a season.</p>
			<p>Such were the happenings in the vision witnessed by Dom Manuel (as Dom Manuel afterward declared) while he sat playing upon the flageolet.</p>
