			</hgroup>
			<p>Now the Count of Poictesme departs from Provence, with his lackeys carrying his images, and early in April he comes to Helmas the Deep-Minded. The wise King was then playing with his small daughter Mélusine (who later dethroned and imprisoned him), but he sent the child away with a kiss, and he attentively heard Dom Manuel through.</p>
			<p>King Helmas looked at the images, prodded them with a shriveled forefinger, and cleared his throat; and then said nothing, because, after all, Dom Manuel was Count of Poictesme.</p>
			<p>“What is needed?” said Manuel.</p>
			<p>“They are not true to life,” replied Helmas⁠—“particularly this one which has the look of me.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I know that: but who can give life to my images?”</p>
			<p>King Helmas pushed back his second best crown, wherein was set the feather from the wing of the miller’s goose, and he scratched his forehead. He said, “There is a power over all figures of earth and a queen whose will is neither to loose nor to bind.” Helmas turned toward a thick book, wherein was magic.</p>
			<p>“Yes, <em>queen</em> is the same as <i xml:lang="ang">cwen</i>. Therefore Queen Freydis of Audela might help you.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, for it is she that owns Schamir. But the falcons are not nesting now, and how can I go to Freydis, that woman of strange deeds?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, people nowadays no longer use falcons; and of course nobody can go to Freydis uninvited. Still, it can be managed that Freydis will come to you when the moon is void and powerless, and when this and that has been arranged.”</p>
			<p>Thereafter Helmas the Deep-Minded told Count Manuel what was requisite. “So you will need such and such things,” says King Helmas, “but, above all, do not forget the ointment.”</p>
			<p>Count Manuel went alone into Poictesme, which was his fief if only he could get it. He came secretly to Upper Morven, that place of horrible fame. Near the ten-colored stone, whereon men had sacrificed to Vel-Tyno in time’s youth, he builded an enclosure of peeled willow wands, and spread butter upon them, and tied them with knots of yellow ribbons, as Helmas had directed. Manuel arranged all matters within the enclosure as Helmas had directed. There Manuel waited, on the last night in April, regarding the full moon.</p>
			<p>In a while you saw the shadowings on the moon’s radiancy begin to waver and move: later they passed from the moon’s face like little clouds, and the moon was naked of markings. This was a token that the Moon-Children had gone to the well from which once a month they fetch water, and that for an hour the moon would be void and powerless. With this and that ceremony Count Manuel kindled such a fire upon the old altar of Vel-Tyno as Helmas had directed.</p>
			<p>Manuel cried aloud: “Now be propitious, infernal, terrestrial and celestial Bombo! Lady of highways, patroness of crossroads, thou who bearest the light! Thou who dost labor always in obscurity, thou enemy of the day, thou friend and companion of darkness! Thou rejoicing in the barking of dogs and in shed blood, thus do I honor thee.”</p>
			<p>Manuel did as Helmas had directed, and for an instant the screamings were pitiable, but the fire ended these speedily.</p>
			<p>Then Manuel cried, again: “O thou who wanderest amid shadows and over tombs, and dost tether even the strong sea! O whimsical sister of the blighting sun, and fickle mistress of old death! O Gorgo, Mormo, lady of a thousand forms and qualities! now view with a propitious eye my sacrifice!”</p>
			<p>Thus Manuel spoke, and steadily the fire upon the altar grew larger and brighter as he nourished it repugnantly.</p>
			<p>When the fire was the height of a warrior, and queer things were happening to this side and to that side, Count Manuel spoke the ordered words: and of a sudden the flames’ colors were altered, so that green shimmerings showed in the fire, as though salt were burning there. Manuel waited. This greenness shifted and writhed and increased in the heart of the fire, and out of the fire oozed a green serpent, the body of which was well-nigh as thick as a man’s body.</p>
			<p>This portent came toward Count Manuel horribly. He, who was familiar with serpents, now grasped this monster’s throat, and to the touch its scales were like very cold glass.</p>
			<p>The great snake shifted so resistlessly that Manuel was forced back toward the fire and toward a doom more dreadful than burning: and the firelight was in the snake’s contemptuous wise eyes. Manuel was of stalwart person, but his strength availed him nothing until he began to recite aloud, as Helmas had directed, the multiplication tables: Freydis could not withstand mathematics.</p>
			<p>So when Manuel had come to two times eleven the tall fire guttered as though it bended under the passing of a strong wind: then the flames burned high, and Manuel could see that he was grasping the throat of a monstrous pig. He, who was familiar with pigs, could see that this was a black pig, caked with dried curds of the Milky Way; its flesh was chill to the touch, like dead flesh; and it had long tusks, which possessed life of their own, and groped and writhed toward Manuel like fat white worms.</p>
			<p>Then Manuel said, as Helmas had directed: “Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl. But Elijah the Tishbite was fed by ravens that brought him bread and flesh.”</p>
			<p>Again the tall flames guttered. Now Manuel was grasping a thick heatless slab of crystal, like a mirror, wherein he could see himself quite clearly. Just as he really was, he, who was not familiar with such mirrors, could see Count Manuel, housed in a little wet dirt with old inveterate stars adrift about him everywhither; and the spectacle was enough to frighten anybody.</p>
			<p>So Manuel said: “The elephant is the largest of all animals, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. Its nostril is elongated, and answers to the purpose of a hand. Its toes are undivided, and it lives two hundred years. Africa breeds elephants, but India produces the largest.”</p>
			<p>The mirror now had melted into a dark warm fluid which oozed between his fingers, dripping to the ground. But Manuel held tightly to what remained between his palms, and he felt, they say, that in the fluid was struggling something small and soft and living, as though he held a tiny minnow.</p>
			<p>Said Manuel, “A straight line is the shortest distance between two points.”</p>
			<p>Of a sudden the fire became an ordinary fire, and the witches of Amneran screamed, and Morven was emptied of sorcery, and Count Manuel was grasping the warm soft throat of a woman. Instantly he had her within the enclosure of peeled willow wands that had been spread with butter and tied with knots of yellow ribbon, because into such an enclosure the power and the dominion of Freydis could never enter.</p>
			<p>All these things Manuel did precisely as King Helmas had directed.</p>
