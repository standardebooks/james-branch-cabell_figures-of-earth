			</hgroup>
			<p>Now the tale tells how, to humor Alianora, Count Manuel applied himself to the magic of the Apsarasas. He went with the Princess to a high secret place, and Alianora, crying sweetly, in the famous old fashion, “<span xml:lang="x-charm">Torolix, Ciccabau, Tio, Tio, Torolililix!</span>” performed the proper incantations, and forthwith birds came multitudinously from all quarters of the sky, in a descending flood of color and flapping and whistling and screeching.</p>
			<p>The peacock screamed, “With what measure thou judgest others, thou shalt thyself be judged.”</p>
			<p>Sang the nightingale, “Contentment is the greatest happiness.”</p>
			<p>The turtledove called, “It were better for some created things that they had never been created.”</p>
			<p>The peewit chirped, “He that hath no mercy for others, shall find none for himself.”</p>
			<p>The stork said huskily, “The fashion of this world passeth away.”</p>
			<p>And the wail of the eagle was, “Howsoever long life may be, yet its inevitable term is death.”</p>
			<p>“Now that is virtually what I said,” declared the stork, “and you are a boldfaced and bald-headed plagiarist.”</p>
			<p>“And you,” replied the eagle, clutching the stork’s throat, “are a dead bird that will deliver no more babies.”</p>
			<p>But Dom Manuel tugged at the eagle’s wing, and asked him if he really meant that to hold good before this Court of the Birds. And when the infuriated eagle opened his cruel beak, and held up one murderous claw, to make solemn oath that indeed he did mean it, and would show them too, the stork very intelligently flew away.</p>
			<p>“I shall not ever forget your kindness, Count Manuel,” cried the stork, “and do you remember that the customary three wishes are always yours for the asking.”</p>
			<p>“And I too am grateful,” said the abashed eagle⁠—“yes, upon the whole, I am grateful, for if I had killed that long-legged pest it would have been in contempt of the court, and they would have set me to hatching red cockatrices. Still, his reproach was not unfounded, and I must think up a new cry.”</p>
			<p>So the eagle perched on a rock, and said tentatively, “There is such a thing as being too proud to fight.” He shook his bald head disgustedly, and tried, “The only enduring peace is a peace without victory,” but that did not seem to content him either. Afterward he cried out, “All persons who oppose me have pygmy minds,” and “If everybody does not do exactly as I order, the heart of the world will be broken”: and many other foolish things he repeated, and shook his head over, for none of these axioms pleased the eagle, and he no longer admired the pedagogue who had invented them.</p>
			<p>So in his worried quest for a saying sufficiently orotund and meaningless to content his ethics, and to be hailed with convenience as a great moral principle, the eagle forgot all about Count Manuel: but the stork did not forget, because in the eyes of the stork the life of the stork is valuable.</p>
			<p>The other birds uttered various such sentiments as have been recorded, and all these, they told Manuel, were accredited sorceries. The big yellow-haired boy did not dispute it, he rarely disputed anything: but the droop to that curious left eye of his was accentuated, and he admitted to Alianora that he wondered if such fainthearted smug little truths were indeed the height of wisdom, outside of religion and public speaking. Then he asked which was the wisest of the birds, and they told him the Zhar-Ptitza, whom others called the Fire-Bird.</p>
			<p>Manuel induced Alianora to summon the Zhar-Ptitza, who is the oldest and the most learned of all living creatures, although he has thus far learned nothing assuredly except that appearances have to be kept up. The Zhar-Ptitza came, crying wearily, “Fine feathers make fine birds.” You heard him from afar.</p>
			<p>The Zhar-Ptitza himself had every reason to get comfort out of this axiom, for his plumage was everywhere the most brilliant purple, except that his neck feathers were the color of new gold, and his tail was blue with somewhat longer red feathers intermingled. His throat was wattled gorgeously, and his head was tufted, and he seemed a trifle larger than the eagle. The Fire-Bird brought with him his nest of cassia and sprigs of incense, and this he put down upon the lichened rocks, and he sat in it while he talked with Manuel.</p>
			<p>The frivolous question that Manuel raised as to his clay figures, the Zhar-Ptitza considered a very human bit of nonsense: and the wise creature said he felt forced to point out that no intelligent bird would ever dream of making images.</p>
			<p>“But, sir,” said Manuel, “I do not wish to burden this world with any more lifeless images. Instead, I wish to make in this world an animated figure, very much as, they say, a god did once upon a time⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Come, you should not try to put too much responsibility upon Jahveh,” protested the Zhar-Ptitza, tolerantly, “for Jahveh made only one man, and did not ever do it again. I remember the making of that first man very clearly, for I was created the morning before, with instructions to fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven, so I saw the whole affair. Yes, Jahveh did create the first man on the sixth day. And I voiced no criticism. For of course after working continuously for nearly a whole week, and making so many really important things, no creative artist should be blamed for not being in his happiest vein on the sixth day.”</p>
			<p>“And did you happen to notice, sir,” asks Manuel, hopefully, “by what method animation was given to Adam?”</p>
			<p>“No, he was drying out in the sun when I first saw him, with Gabriel sitting at his feet, playing on a flageolet: and naturally I did not pay any particular attention to such foolishness.”</p>
			<p>“Well, well, I do not assert that the making of men is the highest form of art, yet, none the less, a geas is upon me to make myself a very splendid and admirable young man.”</p>
			<p>“But why should you be wasting your small portion of breath and strength? To what permanent use could one put a human being even if the creature were virtuous and handsome to look at? Ah, Manuel, you have not seen them pass, as I have seen them pass in swarms, with their wars and their reforms and their great causes, and leaving nothing but their bones behind them.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes, to you, at your age, who were old when Nineveh was planned, it must seem strange; and I do not know why my mother desired that I should make myself a splendid and admirable young man. But the geas is upon me.”</p>
			<p>The Zhar-Ptitza sighed. “Certainly these feminine whims are not easily explained. Yet your people have some way of making brand-new men and women of all kinds. I am sure of this, for otherwise the race would have been extinct a great while since at the rate they kill one another. And perhaps they do adhere to Jahveh’s method, and make fresh human beings out of earth, for, now I think of it, I have seen the small, recently completed ones, who looked exactly like red clay.”</p>
			<p>“It is undeniable that babies do have something of that look,” assented Manuel. “So then, at least, you think I may be working in the proper medium?”</p>
			<p>“It seems plausible, because I am certain your people are not intelligent enough to lay eggs, nor could, of course, such an impatient race succeed in getting eggs hatched. At all events, they have undoubtedly contrived some method or other, and you might find out from the least foolish of them about that method.”</p>
			<p>“Who, then, is the least foolish of mankind?”</p>
			<p>“Probably King Helmas of Albania, for it was prophesied by me a great while ago that he would become the wisest of men if ever he could come by one of my shining white feathers, and I hear it reported he has done so.”</p>
			<p>“Sir,” said Manuel, dubiously, “I must tell you in confidence that the feather King Helmas has is not yours, but was plucked from the wing of an ordinary goose.”</p>
			<p>“Does that matter?” asked the Zhar-Ptitza. “I never prophesied, of course, that he actually would find one of my shining white feathers, because all my feathers are red and gold and purple.”</p>
			<p>“But how can there be any magic in a goose-feather?”</p>
			<p>“There is this magic, that, possessing it, King Helmas has faith in, and has stopped bothering about, himself.”</p>
			<p>“Is not to bother about yourself the highest wisdom?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no! Oh, dear me, no! I merely said it is the highest of which man is capable.”</p>
			<p>“But the sages and philosophers, sir, that had such fame in the old time, and made the maxims for you birds! Why, did King Solomon, for example, rise no higher than that?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes, to be sure!” said the Zhar-Ptitza, sighing again, “now that was a sad error. The poor fellow was endowed with, just as an experiment, considerable wisdom. And it caused him to perceive that a man attains to actual contentment only when he is drunk or when he is engaged in occupations not very decorously described. So Sulieman-ben-Daoud gave over all the rest of his time to riotous living and to coeducational enterprises. It was logic, but it led to a most expensive seraglio and to a very unbecoming appearance, and virtually wrecked the man’s health. Yes, that was the upshot of one of you being endowed with actual wisdom, just as an experiment, to see what would come of it: so the experiment, of course, has never been repeated. But of living persons, I dare assert that you will find King Helmas appreciably freed from a thousand general delusions by his one delusion about himself.”</p>
			<p>“Very well, then,” says Manuel. “I suspect a wilful paradox and a forced cynicism in much of what you have said, but I shall consult with King Helmas about human life and about the figure I have to make in the world.”</p>
			<p>So they bid each other farewell, and the Zhar-Ptitza picked up his nest of cassia and sprigs of incense, and flew away with it: and as he rose in the air the Zhar-Ptitza cried, “Fine feathers make fine birds.”</p>
			<p>“But that is not the true proverb, sir,” Manuel called up toward the resplendent creature, “and such perversions too, they tell me, are a mark of would-be cleverness.”</p>
			<p>“So it may seem to you now, my lad, but time is a very transforming fairy. Therefore do you wait until you are older,” the bird replied, from on high, “and then you will know better than to doubt my cry or to repeat it.”</p>
